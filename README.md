## Included

- Independent tabs components with lazy load. Project converted using [Standalone migration](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/main/packages/core/schematics/ng-generate/standalone-migration) and the example [Angular tabs example using standalone components](https://github.com/sean-perkins/ionic-angular-standalone/tree/main), but the `<ion-router-outlet [environmentInjector]="environmentInjector"></ion-router-outlet>` there were a temporal patch for Angular 14, which was not added into Angular 15, so instructions from [How to lazy load Standalone components in Angular](https://kurtwanger40.medium.com/how-to-lazy-load-standalone-components-ff6b2298259f) were also used.
- Platform dependency centralized for user photos in the specific class PhotoFilesystem, to use user photos regardless of platform 
- Standalone header with an icon for error notification
- IMessage and **messageHub.service**
